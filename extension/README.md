  <h2 align="center">Safire Browser Extension</h2>
</div>

This is the browser extension component of the **Safire** project. It is built using the [Plasmo](https://www.plasmo.com/) framework with React and TypeScript.

---

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to build the extension and load it into your browser for development.

### 1. Installation

Navigate to the `extension` directory and install the dependencies using `pnpm`.

```sh
cd extension
pnpm install
````

### 2. Start the Development Server

Run the development server. This will watch for file changes and rebuild the extension automatically.

```sh
pnpm dev
```

This will create a `build/chrome-mv3-dev` directory, which contains the unpacked extension files.

---

## Loading the Extension in Chrome

Since the extension is not yet on the Chrome Web Store, you need to load it manually. This is a one-time process.

1. Open **Google Chrome** and navigate to `chrome://extensions`. Or just paste this into your browserâ€™s address bar.
2. Enable **Developer mode** using the toggle switch in the top-right corner.
3. Click the **"Load unpacked"** button that appears on the top-left.
4. In the file selection dialog, navigate to the project folder and select the `extension/build/chrome-mv3-dev` directory.
5. Click **"Select Folder"**.

The Safire extension icon <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rajveeerr/Safire/main/extension/assets/icon.png" alt="Safire Logo" width="20"/> should now appear in your browser's toolbar!
