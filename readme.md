<!-- ## The Problem

Online harassment is a critical social issue, disproportionately affecting women and marginalized communities. Existing anti-harassment tools are often inadequate:
- **Reactive, not Proactive**: Users experience trauma *before* any action can betaken.
- **Ineffective Blocking**: Traditional blocking can escalate the situation, as harassers simply create new accounts.
- **Lack of Evidence**: Manually collecting evidence for legal action is difficult, stressful, and often incomplete.
- **Slow Manual Reporting**: Platform reporting systems are slow and often ineffective, leaving victims unprotected.

## Our Solution: Safire

Safire is a browser extension that acts as your personal guardian against online harassment. It uses advanced AI to analyze messages in real-time, proactively hiding harmful content before you see it. Safire silently collects evidence, empowers you to take legal action, and helps create a safer online community.

## Why Safire? The Problem with Online Safety

Online harassment is more than just an inconvenience; it's a pervasive threat that silences voices and creates toxic digital environments. Existing tools are fundamentally broken—they're reactive, they escalate conflict, and they fail to empower victims. We knew there had to be a better way.

| Before Safire ❌ | With Safire ✅ |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Victims see harassing content, causing immediate trauma. | Harmful messages are **proactively hidden** before they're seen. |
| Blocking a harasser often leads to retaliation. | Our **Invisible Shield** works silently, keeping users safe. |
| Gathering evidence for legal action is a manual nightmare. | **One-click legal reports** are automatically generated. |
| You feel alone and unprotected. | **Community-driven tagging** warns others about known harassers. |

## Getting Started: Local Setup

To get a local copy of Safire up and running on your machine, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher recommended)
- [**pnpm**](https://pnpm.io/installation) (Install globally with `npm install -g pnpm`)
- [**MongoDB**](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (A running instance, either locally or on a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas)

### Installation & Setup

#### 1. Clone the Repository

Use Git to clone the Safire project:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rajveeerr/Safire.git
cd Safire
```

#### 2. Choose a Project Component

This is a **monorepo** that contains several independent components:

| Directory            | Description                           | Setup Guide                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `client/`            | Public-facing landing page            | [`client/README.md`](client/README.md)                       |
| `dashboard/`         | User dashboard web application        | [`dashboard/README.md`](dashboard/README.md)                 |
| `extension/`         | Chrome browser extension              | [`extension/README.md`](extension/README.md)                 |
| `server/`            | Main backend API                      | [`server/README.md`](server/README.md)                       |
| `moderation-server/` | AI-based text moderation microservice | [`moderation-server/README.md`](moderation-server/README.md) |


#### 3. Set Up a Component

Navigate into the component you'd like to work on and follow its README for full setup instructions.

For example, to set up the **browser extension**, run:

```sh
cd extension
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Then follow the rest of the [extension's README](extension/README.md) to load it in Chrome.



> 💡 Each component is self-contained and can be developed/tested independently.

> [!NOTE]
> **A Note on Our Development Journey**
> 
> As a project born from the fast-paced and dynamic environment of multiple hackathons, our codebase was migrated between private repositories several times during its initial development. This was necessary to meet deadlines and adapt to evolving requirements.
> 
> Consequently, the commit history visible here doesn't fully capture the extensive, iterative process and the hundreds of commits that went into building Safire from the ground up. The current history reflects the final, polished state of the project as we prepared it for the public.
> 
> We share this note to provide context on our journey and to give a nod to the immense effort, late nights, and passion our team poured into bringing this idea to life.
